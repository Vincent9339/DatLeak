# Tabular DataLeak
Methods for detection of data leakage in a tabular dataset.


When anonymizing data, for instance, by randomizing data orders, it's important to implement safeguards against potential data leakage. Data leakage can occur if scrambled variables inadvertently retain patterns that could be traced back to the original participants. Hence DatLeak can be run to test for data leakage. 

### Full Leakage

A row/participant $i$ is considered to have **full leakage** if the number of matching cells equals the number of valid cells in that row. The condition for full leakage for row $i$ is:


```math
\text{Full Leakage for Row } i = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \text{match\_count}_{i} = \text{valid\_mask\_sum}_{i} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```
```math
\text{Full Leakage Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Full Leakage Count}}{\text{total\_rows}} \right) \times 100
```

### Partial Leakage

A row/participant $i$ is considered to have **partial leakage** if the number of matching cells is greater than 0 but less than the number of valid cells in that row. The condition for partial leakage for row `i` is:

```math
\text{Partial Leakage for Row } i = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } 0 < \text{match\_count}_{i} < \text{valid\_mask\_sum}_{i} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```
```math
\text{Partial Leakage Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Partial Leakage Count}}{\text{total\_rows}} \right) \times 100
```

This formula checks if some, but not all, valid cells match between the original and scrambled rows, indicating partial leakage. 

This script detects data leakage by comparing an original dataset with an anonymized version. It calculates percentages of full leakage (all variables are the same), and partial leakage (some variables are the same). In the latter case, it does so by averaging matching cells (per row). The script accepts command-line inputs for the dataset files (CSV or TSV) and an optional ignore value.

### Requirements
- pandas
- numpy
- python 3.x

### Usage 

```
python DatLeak.py <original_file> <scrambled_file> [ignore_value] [ignore_col]
```
- <original_file>: Path to the CSV or TSV file containing the original data.
- <scrambled_file>: Path to the CSV or TSV file containing the scrambled data.
- [ignore_value]: A value to ignore during the comparison (e.g., NaN or any placeholder value).
- [ignore_col]: A column to ignore during the comparison (ignore_col can be a single integer (e.g., 1) or comma-separated list (e.g., '1,2,3') or list literal (e.g., '[1,2,3]')).

### Example use

```
python DatLeak.py test_files/data_original.tsv test_files/data_scramble.tsv -999 0
# or
python DatLeak.py test_files/data_original.tsv test_files/data_scramble.tsv None 0
# even
python DatLeak.py test_files/data_original.tsv test_files/data_scramble.tsv
```

# NeuroImaging DataLeak



## Introduction
**DataLeak**age analysis in neuro-imaging data

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to analyze information leakage in two neuro-imaging dataset of **Original** and **Scrambled/Synthetic**. We use 3 known methods to measure the similarity between slices by quantifying leakage across all dimensions of the image.

## Methods:
The idea of using three methods is to quantify information leakage is to complement each other’s strengths and limitations, providing a more robust and comprehensive assessment of potential leakage between the original and scrambled data.

`NOTE` Due to the computationally intensive nature of comparing large 3D to 4D arrays slice by slice, we implemented SSIM and Pearson correlation manually instead of using built-in functions from libraries like scipy. To optimize performance, we use [`numba`](https://pypi.org/project/numba/) to JIT-compile the function. However, numba does not support external Python callables like scipy.stats.pearsonr or skimage.ssim
- [`Pearson:`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) Pearson correlation coefficients
    - Useful for detecting global similarity patterns. However sensitive to scaling and outliers, but effective when relationships are purely linear.
- [`SSIM:`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity_index_measure) Structural similarity index measure
    - SSIM is designed to measure perceptual similarity, which takes into account luminance, contrast, and structure.
 
- [`np.allclose:`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.allclose.html) Boolean matrix showing exact match (leakage) in centered data
    - A strict comparison to identify almost exact matches, indicating serious leakage. It also helps to detect accidental duplication or information leakage due to transformations.
### Pseudocode
### 3D
```terminal
# Given a dimension in [x, y, z]
For slice i = 0 to shape − 1: # for each original image slice
    For j = 0 to shape − 1:   # comparing all slices of scrambled 
    a. Extract 2D slices from data_o and data_s based on axis:
        If axis = 0,1,2: # representing [x, y, z]
            slice_o ← data_o[i, :, :] # extracting a plane/2D slice of original
            slice_s ← data_s[j, :, :] # extracting a plane/2D slice of scrambled
    b. Full leakage check:
        f_l_corrs[i, j] ← allclose(slice_o, slice_s)
    c. Compute Pearson correlation:
        p_corrs[i, j] ← p_corr(slice_o, slice_s)
    d. Compute SSIM:
        s_corrs[i, j] ← ssim(slice_o, slice_s)
return p_corrs, s_corrs, f_l_corrs
# returns a numpy array of shape (x,x), (y,y) or (z,z)
```
### 4D

```terminal
# Method 1
For time t = 0 to shape − 1: 
    a. compute 3D as above
return mean(3D)

# Method 2
```
## Usage
```terminal
python run.py <Original Base Dir> <Scrambled Base Dir> [report]
```
- Original/Scrambled base directory: The function searches for images, given one directory above all images
- Report is optional. Takes two arguments of True/False. By default is False
### Example
```terminal
python run.py "usecase2.2/input" "usecase2.2/scrambled" False"
```
## Output
```terminal
 - File shape: (x, y, z, [t])
 - Subject ID: ID
    - Partial Leakage[X]: leakage value
    - Partial Leakage[Y]: leakage value
    - Partial Leakage[Z]: leakage value
- Partial Leakage: %
- Full Leakage: %\begin{matrix}
```
## Full/Partial Leakage Calculation
### `Full Leakage:` 
We consider Full Leakage as identical. Meaning if an original image is 100% identical to the scrambled version. If Pearson Correlation returns a value of [0.999 - 1.0], backed up by SSIM/np.allclose return similar value in any slice across any dimension of [x, y, z].
### `Partial Leakage:` 
Partial Leakage is calculated by using a threshold range of [0.5 - 0.999] from the distribution of **max values** extracted from the Pearson correlation, SSIM, and np.allclose matrices.
- `x` refers to the dimensions of an image in the format dim[x, y, z], and `o,s` are `original` and `scrambled` respectively.
- The left matrix represents the **Pearson correlation** matrix with shape **(x, x)**, where `shape[0]` corresponds to the original dimensions, and `shape[1]` is the correlation between the original and scrambled images.
- The right matrix of shape **(x,)** shows the **maximum values** for each dimension, alongside their respective `x_original` and `x_scrambled` values.
From these matrices, Partial Leakage is computed based on the specified threshold.
```math
\left.
  \begin{matrix}
    x_{o1,s1} & \dots & x_{o1,sN} \\
    x_{o2,s1} & \dots & x_{o2,sN} \\
    \vdots    & \ddots & \vdots  \\
    x_{oN,s1} & \dots & x_{oN,sN} \\
  \end{matrix}
\right\}
\quad
\left.
  \begin{matrix}
    x_{\text{max}1} \\
    x_{\text{max}2} \\
    \vdots \\
    x_{\text{max}N}
  \end{matrix}
\right.
```

## HTML Report
To ensure transparency and verification, and allow for visual inspection of the results, an optional HTML report is generated alongside the leakage analysis. This report provides:

- A side-by-side visual snapshot of the original and scrambled data slices.
- A summary table displaying the computed values for:
    - Pearson correlation: min, max, mean along [x, y, z] dim
    - SSIM: min, max, mean along [x, y, z] dim
- Plots visualizing the distribution of correlation values, helping identify any unexpected alignment or leakage patterns.
    - Total distribution plot
    - Threshold distribution plot: Threshold is set between 0.5 - 0.999
